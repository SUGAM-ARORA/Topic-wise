Kruskalâ€™s algo requires to delete edge with minimum weight at each step. Therefore, if we 
sort edges in ascending order : O(E log E)
and deleting smallest element is O(1) time
For each edge, compare whether adding the edge would create cycle: O(E)
Time required to run loop: O(E log E + E)
Total running time = O(E log E + E) = O(E log E)
