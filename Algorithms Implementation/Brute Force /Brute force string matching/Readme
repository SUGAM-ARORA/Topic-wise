The simplest algorithm for string matching is a brute force algorithm, where
we simply try to match the first character of the pattern with the first
character of the text, and if we succeed, try to match the second character,
and so on; if we hit a failure point, slide the pattern over one character and
try again. When we find a match, return its starting location.

Code for the brute force method:

for (int i = 0; i < n-m; i++) {
int j = 0;
while (j < m && t[i+j] == p[j]) {
j++;
}
if (j == m) return i;
}
printf(‘‘No match found’’);
return -1;

The outer loop is executed at most n-m+1 times, and the inner loop m
times, for each iteration of the outer loop. Therefore, the running time of
this algorithm is in O(nm).
