Let us take an example when n = 50. So we need to print all prime numbers smaller than or equal to 50. 

We create a list of all numbers from 2 to 50.  

Sieve1

According to the algorithm we will mark all the numbers which are divisible by 2 and are greater than or equal to the square of it.

Now we move to our next unmarked number 3 and mark all the numbers which are multiples of 3 and are greater than or equal to the square of it.

We move to our next unmarked number 5 and mark all multiples of 5 and are greater than or equal to the square of it.  

Sieve4

We continue this process and our final table will look like below:  

Sieve5

So the prime numbers are the unmarked ones: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47.
