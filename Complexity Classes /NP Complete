 A problem is NP-complete if it is both NP and NP-hard
 Suppose we have 2 problems R and Q
 R is a NP-Complete problem and it is reducible to Q
 R  Q (in polynomial time) Then Q is at least as hard as R
 Since R is an NP-hard problem, therefore Q will also be at least NP-hard, it may be NPcomplete also
 If one NP-Complete problem can be solved in polynomial time, then all NP problems can
solved in polynomial time
