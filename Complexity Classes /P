 P means Polynomial Time
 Class P refers to the set of decision problems that can be solved by a deterministic
algorithm in polynomial time
 In other words, P is the set of problems for which there exists an algorithm that can find
the solution in a reasonable amount of time, where the running time of the algorithm is
proportional to a polynomial function of the input size
 O(1), O(n), O(n²), etc

Examples :
 Sorting a list of n elements
 Searching a smallest element in an array
 Minimal Spanning Tree
