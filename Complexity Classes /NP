 Non-deterministic Polynomial Time
 Collection of decision problems that can be solved by a non-deterministic algorithm in
polynomial time
 The class NP refers to the set of decision problems for which a solution can be verified in
polynomial time by a non- deterministic algorithm
 Convert exponential into polynomial with non-deterministic algorithm
 Some statements are non-deterministic

Examples :
 0/1 Knapsack
 Travelling Salesperson
 Sudoku
