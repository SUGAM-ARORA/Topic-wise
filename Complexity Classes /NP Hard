 Suppose we have two problems, A and B where Problem B is a NP class problem
 If problem A can be reduced or converted to problem B, and this reduction takes a
polynomial amount of time
 A  B (in polynomial time)
 Then we can say that if A is a NP hard problem (A is reducible to B)
 B also becomes a NP hard problem

 An NP-hard problem is at least as hard as the hardest problem in NP
 A problem is classified as NP-Hard when an algorithm for solving it can be translated to
solve any NP problem
